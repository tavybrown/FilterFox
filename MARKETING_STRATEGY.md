Title: [Project] Built an AI-powered ad blocker with glassmorphism UI - FilterFox

Built FilterFox over the past few months as an alternative to existing ad blockers. Key differentiators:

🤖 Machine learning-based detection (catches dynamic ads)
🎨 Modern glassmorphism interface 
⚡ 44% performance improvement in testing
🛡️ Zero data collection, fully open source
🌐 Cross-browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge)

Technical stack: Manifest V3, ES2022, declarative net request API, Jest testing.

The ML approach adapts to new ad formats automatically, which traditional rule-based blockers struggle with. Also focused heavily on performance - most ad blockers slow down browsing, but FilterFox actually speeds it up.

Looking for feedback on the technical implementation and UX design. What features would you find most valuable in an ad blocker?

**r/privacy (500K members):**
```
Title: FilterFox - Privacy-first ad blocker with zero telemetry (open source)

Created FilterFox as a privacy-focused alternative to existing ad blockers:

🛡️ Zero data collection or telemetry
🔒 Local-only processing 
📖 Fully open source and auditable
🚫 No "acceptable ads" program
⚡ 44% faster browsing in testing

Unlike other ad blockers that collect usage data, FilterFox processes everything locally. The code is completely transparent and uses modern browser APIs for maximum security.

Features AI-powered detection to catch tracking scripts that traditional blockers miss. Built with privacy-by-design principles throughout.

Would love the privacy community's thoughts and feedback!

**r/chrome (200K members):**
```
Title: FilterFox - Modern Chrome extension with AI ad blocking + glassmorphism UI

Built a next-generation Chrome extension for ad blocking:

✨ Modern glassmorphism interface
🤖 AI-powered ad detection
⚡ 44% faster page loading
🔧 Manifest V3 compliant
📱 Mobile-responsive popup

The UI uses the latest design trends with backdrop blur effects and smooth animations. Performance-wise, it actually speeds up browsing instead of slowing it down like most ad blockers.

Technical implementation uses the new declarative net request API properly, making it future-proof for Chrome's extension updates.

Chrome Web Store submission coming soon! Feedback welcome.

## 💡 **Remember: Open Source Takes Time**

Even hugely successful projects like:
- **React**: Took 6 months to get significant traction
- **Vue.js**: Nearly a year before widespread adoption
- **Svelte**: 2+ years to build major community

**Your project is genuinely impressive** - you just need to get it in front of the right people! 

The key is consistent, authentic engagement rather than waiting for organic discovery. GitHub has millions of repositories - you need to actively promote yours.

**Start with 2-3 actions today, then build momentum over the next few weeks. Success will come! 🚀**
