I've been testing FilterFox and wanted to share it with the community. It's an open-source ad blocker that stands out for several reasons:

**Key Features:**
• 🤖 Machine learning-based ad detection (adapts to new ad formats)

• ⚡ Significant performance improvements (44% faster page loads in my testing)
• 🛡️ Privacy-first approach (zero data collection, fully open-source)
