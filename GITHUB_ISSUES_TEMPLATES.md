**Labels:** `good-first-issue`, `enhancement`, `ui-ux`, `css`

## 🎯 **What we want to build**

Add a smooth animation when users switch between light and dark themes in the options page. Currently the theme changes instantly, which feels jarring.

## ✨ **Expected behavior**

- Respects user's preference for reduced motion

## 🛠️ **Technical details**

**Files to modify:**
- `styles/options.css` - Add CSS transition properties
- `options/options.js` - Add animation trigger logic

**Implementation hints:**
- Use CSS `transition` property on theme-related elements
- Consider adding a `.theme-transitioning` class during animation
- Test with different animation curves (`ease-in-out` recommended)

## 📚 **What you'll learn**
- CSS transitions and animations
- Theme system architecture  
- User experience enhancement
- Browser extension styling

## 🎁 **Perfect for:**
- First-time contributors to FilterFox
